A Claude skill to help founders write viral Reddit posts and authentic comments
# Reddit Growth Skill for Founders

A prompt skill for Claude (and other AI assistants) that helps founders write Reddit posts and comments that actually work — without getting flagged, downvoted, or looking like a bot.

> ⭐ **Full version with updates coming to [Karis](https://karis.im).** This GitHub release is the current free version.

## What This Does

Most founders fail on Reddit because they either pitch too hard or sound like a press release. This skill fixes that.

Load it into any AI assistant and it becomes a Reddit growth co-pilot that knows:

- Which subreddits to post in (and which ones will get you banned)
- What post formats actually get upvotes — with real data from a 40,000+ view account
- How to write comments that build reputation without being salesy
- When to mention your product, and when to shut up
- How to warm up a new account before Reddit's algorithm trusts you

---

## Three Modes

**Mode 1 — Post only**
Generate a ready-to-post Reddit post for your product or milestone.

**Mode 2 — Comment only**
Find threads to engage with, score them by relevance, and draft authentic comments.

**Mode 3 — Both**
Full Reddit growth session: post + comment opportunities in one go.

## How to Use

1. Copy the full contents of `reddit-SKILL-final.md`
2. Paste it into the system prompt or custom instructions of Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant
3. Tell the AI:
   - Your current Reddit Karma
   - Your product URL or a short description of what it does
   - What you want to do (post, comment, or both)
4. The AI will take it from there

## What's Inside

**Subreddit Selection Guide** — Real performance data (Feb 2026) across 11 founder subreddits including r/SideProject, r/SaaS, r/buildinpublic, r/Entrepreneur, r/indiehackers, and more. Includes top post counts, best use cases, and what gets you removed.

**5 Post Formulas** — Each with real post examples that hit 300–1200 upvotes:
- "I Built" Demo (for r/SideProject)
- Quit-My-Job Journey Story (for r/buildinpublic)
- Milestone / MRR Share (for r/SaaS)
- Contrarian / Honest Insight (for r/Entrepreneur)
- Beta Recruitment (for r/alphaandbetausers)

**Comment Writing System** — Covers how to sound like a real person, not a marketer. Includes the Bar Test, 4 comment archetypes, a product mention ladder (Level 0–4), and bad vs. good examples across 5 real scenarios.

**Warm-Up Plan for New Accounts** — Step-by-step 3-week plan based on a real account that went from 0 to 132 Karma and 40,000+ views.

**Cross-Posting Strategy** — Validated subreddit combinations with real upvote data. The r/buildinpublic + r/microsaas combo alone generated 735 combined upvotes on a single milestone post.

**Pre-Flight Checklists** — One for posts, one for comments. If 2+ red flags, the AI rewrites.
